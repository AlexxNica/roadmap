## Community Pipeline

### Next

- Metrics: looking at contributions (e.g. percent from non-maintainers,
  distribution of number of contributions)
- Create a basic "overview of Jupyter" page with at least a listing of all the
  projects in the Jupyter repo plus a short description of each
- Create the common development guide for all Jupyter projects
- Create the repo maintainer checklist and identify which repos need to add
  which things from the checklist. Carol will take a first pass at this.
- Come up with a checklist/cheatsheet for developers. This should include things
  like the repo maintainer checklist as well as a guidelines for how to respond
  to issues and PRs, conduct, etc. This should be linked to from the Jupyter
  incubation instructions and from the development guide.
- Create thoughtful replies for common reasons that a PR might be closed (e.g.
  pep8 changes). We can't actually use the GitHub saved replies for this because
  those are per-person rather per repo, but we can write a template for people
  to use at least.

### Next + 1

- Continue fleshing out the "overview of Jupyter" page and include things like:
  * a dependency tree
  * better descriptions of how the projects relate to each other
  * status indicators
- All projects should link to the common development guide and should satisfy
  all of the maintainer checklist requirements.
- Grant access to 1 or 2 people who are not maintainers to be issue triagers --
  this will just involve labeling issues as they come in and going back through
  old PRs/issues periodically.
- Include in the newsletter both a "maintainer of the month" (someone with
  commit bits) and a "contributor of the month" (someone without commit bits)
- Include in the newsletter a list of new contributors since the last newsletter

### Future

- Create a bot to take actions on issues based on labels (e.g. "duplicate" gets
  closed automatically).
- Create a mentorship mailing list (based on the Python Core Mentorship mailing
  list) for new contributors to ask questions
