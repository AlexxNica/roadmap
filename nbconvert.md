## nbconvert

### Next (4.2)

* Bring examples of nbconvert functionality that exists in locations like @takluyver's
  demos from last summer's Southampton workshop into the official docs.

### Future

* Explore implementing nbconvert using Pandoc extensions.
* Explore implementing the html output of nbconvert using node.js and the various npm packages we are creating to avoid reimplementing all of the HTML logic.
* Implement an exporter for EPUB.
