## Documentation

We list documentation as a top-level section in our roadmap to acknowledge the importance
of it for developer communication, scaling and maintenance of deployments, and early user
adoption of new releases. The state of the existing documentation has not kept pace with
the rapid development in our projects, and effort will be focused on improving it. Because
our documentation spans all subprojects, each of which have their own release cycles and
versioning, the documentation roadmap doesn't have concrete version numbers associated with
each milestone.

### Next

* Hire full time and part time staff who will focus on improving our documentation.
* Research existing tools for writing documentation (Readthedocs, Sphinx, Notebooks, etc.)
  and evaluate which tools we use to write documentation.
* Develop a project wide outline of our existing and proposed documentation.
* Perform observational and survey based user studies of our documentation to guide its
  design and development.
* Explore and research the questions around how to maintain documentation across multiple
  subprojects. Do we centralize all or some of our documentation? Do we keep it in separate
  subproject repos?
* Build publicly accessible API documentation on all commits for all JavaScript and
  TypeScript repositories.
* Encode documentation in our project principles and community process as a core activity
  that is part of the everyday process of development, and adopt this in an integral
  fashion throughout the project for all project members.

### Next+1

* Integrate Jupyter Notebooks more closely into our documentation tools.
* Develop a formal documentation process and standard that includes technical review,
  organizational review, design, usability testing and copy-editing.* Where needed, develop
  additional tools for writing our documentation.
* Work with each subproject to integrate our documentation tools and process into their
  workflow and roadmap.

### Future

* Begin to block releases of subprojects until documentation meets our standards.
* Using our new JavaScript packages and live kernels hosted in the cloud, enable
  documentation to be runnable in place.
* Build documentation indexing and search into JupyterLab.
* Build tools that make it easier for downstream projects to distribute notebook based
  documentation to users.
